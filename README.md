# PlanWell Vault Starter

This repository contains exactly one starter vault in `./vault`.

## Important
Set `vault_path` to the `vault` directory, not repo root:

```toml
vault_path = "/absolute/path/to/planwell-vault-starter/vault"
```

If you downloaded a ZIP, point `vault_path` to the folder that directly contains:
- `classes/`
- `events/`
- `categories/`
- `todos/`
- `settings/`
